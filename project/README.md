### KTH H17P02 - Scalable Machine Learning and Deep Learning
#### Project - Music genre classification

The project revolves around predicting the genre of songs. We train a deep convolutional neural network on our collection of .mp3 songs that we have converted to spectrogram images and labeled by genre. We use the trained model to classify .mp3 songs by genre and test prediction accuracy.
